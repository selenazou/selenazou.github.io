            <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
            <p>ScummVM is a program which provides support for users to play select adventure or role-playing
                games on systems for which they were not designed. It is an open-source project. Further details can
                be found on the project website: <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">scummvm.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Over the course of this project, we will analyze ScummVM's documentation and implementation 
                to understand its conceptual and concrete architecture.
            </p>
